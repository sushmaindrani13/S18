      <p>
        Innovations in clean energy are central to achieving a sustainable future and mitigating climate change. 
        Offshore wind energy, particularly floating wind technologies, represents a significant breakthrough in renewable energy generation.
        By leveraging these innovative approaches, offshore wind energy can complement diminishing onshore and nearshore resources,
        playing a pivotal role in decarbonizing industries and meeting rising energy demands sustainably.
      </p>
      <p>
        Equally transformative is the development of energy storage solutions, such as advanced batteries. 
        Modern batteries are essential for stabilizing power grids and advancing low-emission mobility through electric vehicles.
        Innovations in materials and manufacturing processes aim to make batteries more cost-effective, environmentally friendly, 
        and efficient, ensuring they remain a cornerstone in the clean energy transition.

      <p>
        This project uses Angular for the frontend, offering a dynamic and responsive user interface. 
        Node.js serves as the backend, providing a lightweight and scalable environment for handling API requests and authentication. 
        MongoDB is employed as the database, enabling efficient storage and retrieval of user data.
        The authentication mechanism relies on JSON Web Tokens (JWT), ensuring secure and stateless user sessions.
        The application is structured with a clear separation of concerns, using services for business logic and routing to manage navigation.
